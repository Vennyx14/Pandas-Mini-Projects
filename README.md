# Pandas-Mini-Projects

This repository I am learning how to use the Pandas library as part of my *#100DaysOfCode* challenge.

The examples are split across 2 notebooks:

1. **Pandas Basics Reference - 1.ipynb**
   1. How to read the data from various file formats
   2. Inspecting the rows and columns in the data
   3. Iterating thorough the rows of the DataFrame
   4. Selecting rows based on particular conditions
   5. Getting quick statistics from the DataFrame
   6. Sorting the DataFrame
   7. Adding and dropping columns from the DataFrame
   8. Changing the order of the columns in the DataFrame
   9. Saving the modified DataFrame in various file formats
      1. Selecting whether to *include* or *exclude* the index
      2. Selecting the separator character
2. **Pandas Basics Reference - 2.ipynb**
   1. Filtering the data
   2. Complex filtering operations
   3. Using Regular Expressions for effective searching
   4. Changing the data in the rows matching a particular condition
   5. Aggregate statistics using the `.groupby()` method
   6. Working with large amounts of data by working with chunks
